Ans1) A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed. Differences between SQL and NoSQL are as follows:
* Databases are categorized as Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). NoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or distributed database system.
* SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.
* SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database. NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.
* SQL databases are vertically scalable. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
* MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, PostgreSQL and MS-SQL etc. are the example of SQL database. MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc. are the example of nosql database

Ans2) DDL is short name of Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.
CREATE - to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure and function)
Ex:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);

DROP - delete objects from the database
Ex:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP COLUMN Address;

ALTER - alters the structure of the existing database
Ex:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD Email varchar(255);

TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
Ex:
TRUNCATE TABLE Persons;

Ans3) DML is short name of Data Manipulation Language which deals with data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database.
INSERT - insert data into a table
Ex:
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Soumya', 'Rai', 'Bangalore ',  '4006', 'India');

UPDATE - updates existing data within a table
Ex:
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Soumya Rai', City= 'Bengalore'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

DELETE - Delete all records from a database table
Ex:
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Soumya Rai';

Ans4) DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.
SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.
Ex:
SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;

Ans5) Primary Key: A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence. It uniquely identifies a record in the relational database table.
Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. It refers to the field in a table which is the primary key of another table.

Ans6) 
import mysql.connector
conn = mysql.connector.connect(user = 'username',
							host = 'localhost',
							database = 'database_name')

print(conn)
conn.close()

The MySQLCursor of mysql-connector-python (and similar libraries) is used to execute statements to communicate with the MySQL database. Using the methods of it you can execute SQL statements, fetch data from the result sets, call procedures. You can create Cursor object using the cursor() method of the Connection object/class. 

Ans7)Order of Execution SQL queries adhere to a specific order when evaluating clauses, similar to how mathematical operations adhere to PEMDAS or BIDMAS. From the eyes of the user, queries begin from the first clause and end at the last clause. However, queries actually read from top to bottom when carried out. The order in which the clauses in queries are executed is as follows: 
1. FROM/JOIN: The FROM and/or JOIN clauses are executed first to determine the data of interest. 
2. WHERE: The WHERE clause is executed to filter out records that do not meet the constraints. 
3. GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is executed to group the data based on the values in one or more columns. 
4. HAVING: The HAVING clause is executed to remove the created grouped records that do not meet the constraints.
5. SELECT: The SELECT clause is executed to derive all desired columns and expressions. 
6. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is executed to sort the derived values in ascending or descending order. 
7. LIMIT/OFFSET: Finally, the LIMIT and/or OFFSET clauses are executed to keep or skip a specified number of rows.
